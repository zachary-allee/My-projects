# NBA Trends


I recently found a really cool dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wyattowalsh/basketball) and I have been having fun digging around and thought I would share cool things I come accross.

# 1. Visualizing the scoring boom

I wanted to visualize how scoring has changed over time. I have all the point data in the dataset already but to properly compare accross eras we need to account. The standard way this is done is by using per possesion data. When discussing offense and defensive rating it is usually measured in points per 100 possesions.

I thought possession was a tracked stat but I recently discovered that it is actually calculated!
